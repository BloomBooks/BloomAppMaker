# BloomAppMaker
An Angular 2 web app for managing orders for Bloom Book smartphone Apps.

In this repo, some content is generated from Bloom Library using grunt, which are /vendor /src /asserts and index.html.
Eventually, we need to find out how to build it with Angular 2

# install Angular 2 packages:
  npm install
  
# run on local server:
  npm start
